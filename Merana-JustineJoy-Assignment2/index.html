            <h2 class="subtitle">What are the Cage Homes?</h2>
            <img src="img/cagehome-grandpa.jpg" alt="Elderly Man sitting in his cage home">
            <p>The photo above taken by Bobby Yip is an example of what a typical Cage Home in Hong Kong looks like. They are on average two metres long and one metre wide, for a cage home of this size it can cost approximately 300-400 Canadian dollars. For every room that houses a cage home there could be at least another 5 people that live in the shared space.</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Why do people live here?</h2>
            <p>With Hong Kong's economy becoming more expensive for the lower income households, families resort to living in cramped places just to have somewhere to call a place a home in a city that makes it difficult for lower income families.</p>
